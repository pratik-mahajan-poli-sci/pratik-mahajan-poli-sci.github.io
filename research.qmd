Abstract

</button>

::: {style="display:none;"}
-   Explores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.
-   **Mixed-Method Research Design**: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 voters in 10 villages, 20 elites).

*Co-Author With [Feyaad Allie](https://www.feyaadallie.com/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === &#39;block&#39; ? &#39;none&#39; : &#39;block&#39;;">

Abstract

</button>

::: {style="display:none;"}
-   Examines how non-partisan grassroots organizations (GOs) engage voters during elections using shadowing, a vignette experiment with 730 organizational workers, and a conjoint experiment with 2368 voters. Explores whether GOs are selective or expansive in partisan voter outreach, and whether this perceived advantage holds up on the voter side.

*Co-Author With [Alyssa Heinze](https://alyssaheinze.github.io/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === &#39;block&#39; ? &#39;none&#39; : &#39;block&#39;;">

Abstract

::: {style="display:none;"}
-   Analyzes awareness and impact of bureaucratic rule on perceptions of service delivery and democracy amid delays in local body elections in Maharashtra. This study uses surveys of 2300 voters and 1400 organizational and party workers across four districts. Finding low voter awareness, it seeks to run a follow-up experiment with 3000 voters providing knowledge of local body elected status, to see whether knowledge counters voter apathy.

#### **Divergent Marginalization: How Indigenous and Lower Caste Women Face Divergent Outcomes in Rural Governance**

*Co-Author With [Alyssa Heinze](https://alyssaheinze.github.io/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === &#39;block&#39; ? &#39;none&#39; : &#39;block&#39;;">

Abstract

</button>

::: {style="display:none;"}
-   Analyzing data on 3600 vacant village council seats in Maharashtra (India), we find seats reserved for indigenous women are overrepresented amongst vacant seats three times their share of the population, while vacant Dalit women seats represent just below their share of the population. Using surveys of village council leaders and 3000 voters in Maharashtra, the study seeks to examine the cause and consequence of this divergence.

Abstract

</button>

::: {style="display:none;"}
-   Explores perceptions of dynasts versus non-dynasts on political metrics using surveys of 1400 party workers and 2000 voters. Finds that voter preference for dynasts is mediated by their own ambition for higher office.

Abstract
