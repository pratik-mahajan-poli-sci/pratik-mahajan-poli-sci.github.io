    "text": "Working Papers\nIdeological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India Under Review\n\nExplores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.\nMixed-Method Research Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 in 10 villages)\n\nTriangulating Conjoint Findings Amongst Low Literacy and Remote Populations: A Visual and Interview Approach Under development as a research note\n\nCritical discussion of the interpretive power of using designed graphics to conduct conjoint analyses, and incorporating subsequent interviews as a robustness check of findings while administering conjoint surveys in contexts where literacy and digital infrastructure are low and outsider skepticism is high.\n\nTurning Right After Protesting? Measuring the Impact of the Save Narmada Movement on Scheduled Tribes Voting for the Bharatiya Janata Party Preliminary Analysis\n\nUtilizing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, the study explores whether dissatisfaction with the failure of the Save Narmada Movement, particularly after the Supreme Court’s ruling in favour of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, led to a populist backlash resulting in increased support for the BJP among the Bhil tribes in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.\nComparison of BJP vote share in Bhil-dominated assembly constituencies inside and outside the Narmada Basin before and after the Supreme Court’s decision, to determine if the movement’s failure influenced the electoral rise of the BJP in the Bhil tribal belt. Preliminary analysis points to a null result.\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\nNon-Partisan Grassroots Organizations as Electoral Actors: Evidence from Inside an Organizational Campaign in India (With Feyaad Allie)\n\nOngoing research on the dynamics of Bharat Jodo Abhiyan in Maharashtra, a front of grassroots organizations participating in electoral mobilization.\nWe seek to develop a theory and provide evidence for why grassroots organizations enter electoral politics, and what they perceive their comparative advantage to be vis-a-vis political parties.\n\nAmbition and Ability amongst Party Workers in India (With Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma)\n\nProject in its nascent stage.\nWe seek to theorize how rank-and-file party workers in hierarchical party systems such as India balance ambition for political power and upward mobility and the ability to realize that ambition.\n\nSubdistricts of India by Scheduled Status: An Original Dataset\n\nSubdistrict (tehsil/mandal/block) level spatial dataset with information on Fifth and Sixth Scheduled Areas of India.\nCoded with SHRUG location indicators for ease of merging with other datasets.\n\nMapping the Intersection: Average Wait Time for Housing Vouchers in Relation to Minority Household Percentage (With Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski) Under Development as Spatial Data Visualization\nChanging Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations (With Vikramaditya Thakur) Under development with Asian Ethnicity for special-issue\n\nExplores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misplaced conception that increased education amongst Bhils would lead to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, this paper argues that Bhil tribal identity is seeing a revival amongst the educated and young Bhils due to electoral and social policy factors.\nMulti-Method Research Design: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur)\n\n\n\nPublic Writing\n\n“The Maha Gondhal: Maharashtra LS polls have never been muddier.” The Times of India, 2024.

    "text": "Mapping the Intersection: Average Wait Time for Housing Vouchers in Relation to Minority Household Percentage\n\n\n(With Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski)\nAs a fellow of CAnD3, I coauthored a data visualization that explores the relationship between average wait times for housing vouchers and the percentage of minority households at the county level across the United States.\n\n\n\nMapping the Intersection\n\n\nHere we have produced a bivariate map of the United States, illustrating the average wait time for households to receive housing vouchers, overlaid with the percentage of minority households using county-level data.\nYou’ll notice as the percentage of minority households increases, there’s a slight tendency for the wait time to also increase.\nIn our visualization, we deliberately chose not to control for population density to highlight the impact of minority density in urban areas. By doing so, we aim to accurately portray the correlation between minority population and wait times for housing vouchers, without diluting the influence of urban demographics on this relationship.\nAs you can see, there’s a graph to the bottom left which indicates a relationship between the average wait time for housing vouchers and the density of minority households. While this general trend may be weak across the nation, here we have identified the spatial distribution of inequities.\nIt is clear that coastal regions, encompassing both the western and eastern coasts, demonstrate a significant clustering of prolonged average wait times and notable densities of minority households. These regions call for specific focus and increased investment in supplementary housing support measures, namely in the supply of available housing units."

    "text": "Hello/Namaskar!\nI am a student, researcher, and practitioner of political representation and development in rural India. My academic and experiential work grapples with questions of how political representation is realized in unexpected and divergent ways, particularly among the Scheduled Tribes (Adivasis) and non-state interest groups that work outside the electoral channels.\nI do so while balancing multiple hats, collaborating with academics and grassroots organizations (jan sangathans), to observe and improve gaps in political representation. I have previously worked on a project explaining the electoral and ideological dynamics of rising Hindu nationalism in constituencies reserved for Scheduled Tribes in Maharashtra. My upcoming projects involve academic and practical collaborations with grassroots organizations seeking to improve the electoral agency and participation of ethnic and gender minority voters in Maharashtra.\nI graduated with a MA in Political Science (Development Studies) in May 2024 from McGill University, Canada. I have been a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) in Montreal, as well as a fellow at the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Drive Decision-Making (CAnD3). Prior to my MA, I completed a BA (First Class Honours) in Political Science at McGill University."
