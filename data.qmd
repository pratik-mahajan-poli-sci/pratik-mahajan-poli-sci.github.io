-   	This dataset uses Local Government Directory (LGD) codes assigned by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in India to match villages to their corresponding Gram Panchayats, and further links them to SHRUG's shrid level identifiers to allow for GP level analysis of census data which is normally collected at the village level. Overall I achieve 90% accuracy in matching villages from SHRUG census identifiers with their corresponding GPs, with above 95% accuracy in most major Indian states.
