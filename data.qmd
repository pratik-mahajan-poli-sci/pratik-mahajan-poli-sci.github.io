- This dataset links SHRUG's village- and town-level identifiers (shrid) to their corresponding local governance bodies using official LGD (Local Government Directory) codes from the Government of India. 
- Each observation is matched to either a Gram Panchayat or an Urban Local Body, enabling governance-level analysis of census and economic data. 
- The matching achieves 90.41% coverage overall, with over 95% accuracy in most major Indian states. Discrepancies are summarized in documentation.
