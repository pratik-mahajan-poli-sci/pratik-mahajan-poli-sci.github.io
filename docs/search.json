    "text": "Welcome!\nI am a final year Master’s student in the Department of Political Science, McGill University. My research interests lie in exploring the challenges to and conditions for better electoral representation and development outcomes for marginalized groups in rural and semi-urban India, particularly Scheduled Tribes and OBCs, through a political behaviour, political economy, and nested identity lenses.\nMy current research explores the electoral shift of the Bhil, a Scheduled Tribes group in western India, toward the Hindu-nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Relying on fieldwork including intensive interviews and quantitative survey experiments in 40 villages, I argue that tribal identity and material interests remain salient amongst Bhils despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization.\nI am currently a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) in Montreal, as well as a fellow at the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Drive Decision-Making (CAnD3) Prior to my MA, I completed a BA (First Class Honours) in Political Science at McGill University."

Access Draft\n\nExplores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.\nMixed-Method Research Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 in 10 villages)\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\nChanging Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations (With Vikramaditya Thakur) Under Development for a Special Issue\n\nExplores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misplaced conception that increased education amongst Bhils would lead to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, this paper argues that Bhil tribal identity is seeing a revival amongst the educated and young Bhils due to electoral and social policy factors.\nMulti-Method Research Design: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur)\n\nThe Housing Gap: A Report on Inequity in Housing Affordability in the Canadian Population (With Kate Marr-Laing Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski) Under development as part of CAnD3 Fellowship\nTriangulating Conjoint Findings Amongst Low Literacy and Remote Populations: A Visual and Interview Approach Under development as a research note\n\nCritical discussion of the interpretive power of using designed graphics to conduct conjoint analyses, and incorporating subsequent\ninterviews as a robustness check of findings while administering conjoint surveys in contexts where literacy and digital infrastructure\nare low and outsider skepticism is high.\n\nTurning Right After Protesting? Measuring the Impact of the Save Narmada Movement on Scheduled Tribes Voting for the Bharatiya Janata Party Preliminary Analysis\n\nUtilizing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, the study explores whether dissatisfaction with the failure of the Save Narmada\nMovement, particularly after the Supreme Court’s ruling in favour of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, led to a populist backlash resulting in\nincreased support for the BJP among the Bhil tribes in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh\nComparison of BJP vote share in Bhil-dominated assembly constituencies inside and outside the Narmada Basin before and after the Supreme Court’s decision, to determine if the movement’s failure influenced the electoral rise of the BJP in the Bhil tribal belt. Preliminary analysis points to a null result.\n\n\n\nStudent Reviewed Publications\nMahajan, Pratik. 2023. “The Politics Behind Love Jihad in India: Understanding the Spread of the Conspiracy Theory in 2014.” A Contemporary Review of Genocide and Political Violence.
