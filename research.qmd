### Working Papers

#### **Ideological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India**

*Under Review*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Explores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.
- **Mixed-Method Research Design**: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 voters in 10 villages, 20 elites).

#### **Bringing Forward the Past? Persistence of Bhil Tribal Identity Among Youth Amid Rising Hindu Nationalism in Rural Western India**

*Under Review*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Traces the generational divide in social expression of indigenous identity amongst Bhils in Western India.
</div>

#### **Discretionary Partisans: How Grassroots Organizations Reconcile Mandate and Electoral Engagement**

*Equal Co-Author With [Feyaad Allie](https://www.feyaadallie.com/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Introduces the concept of grassroots organizations as discretionary partisans, initiating partisan collaboration with parties but varying its intensity depending on the candidate's compatibility with their values. Uses shadowing and a vignette experiment with 730 GO and 736 party workers.
- **Pre-registration**: [OSF](https://osf.io/xnkqwa).
</div>

#### **Changing Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations**

*Second Author With [Vikramaditya Thakur](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/cas/units/departments/anthropology/our-people/vikramaditya-thakur/)*

*Under development with Asian Ethnicity for special-issue*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Explores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misplaced conception that increased education amongst Bhils would lead to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, this paper argues that Bhil tribal identity is seeing a revival amongst the educated and young Bhils due to electoral and social policy factors.
- **Multi-Method Research Design**: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur).

### Ongoing Projects



#### **Organizational Expansiveness and Voter Selectivity: How Voters Respond to Partisan Mobilization by Grassroots Organizations**

*Equal Co-Author With [Feyaad Allie](https://www.feyaadallie.com/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Examines how non-partisan grassroots organizations (GOs) engage voters during elections using shadowing, a vignette experiment with 730 organizational workers, and a conjoint experiment with 2368 voters. Explores whether GOs are selective or expansive in partisan voter outreach, and whether this perceived advantage holds up on the voter side.
- **Pre-registration**: [OSF](https://osf.io/9buxy).
</div>

#### **Can Knowledge Make Voters Demand Accountability for Delayed Local Government Elections?**

*Equal Co-Author With [Alyssa Heinze](https://alyssaheinze.github.io/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Analyzes awareness and impact of bureaucratic rule on perceptions of service delivery and democracy amid delays in local body elections in Maharashtra. This study uses surveys of 2300 voters and 1400 organizational and party workers across four districts. Finding low voter awareness, it seeks to run a follow-up experiment with 3000 voters providing knowledge of local body elected status, to see whether knowledge counters voter apathy.
- **Pre-registration**: [OSF](https://osf.io/2nkz8).

#### **Divergent Marginalization: How Indigenous and Lower Caste Women Face Divergent Outcomes in Rural Governance**

*Equal Co-Author With [Alyssa Heinze](https://alyssaheinze.github.io/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Analyzing data on 3600 vacant village council seats in Maharashtra (India), we find seats reserved for indigenous women are overrepresented amongst vacant seats three times their share of the population, while vacant Dalit women seats represent just below their share of the population. Using surveys of village council leaders and 3000 voters in Maharashtra, the study seeks to examine the cause and consequence of this divergence.
</div>

#### **Dynasts and Aspirational Pragmatism: The Role of Electoral Ambition in Shaping Citizens' Perceptions of Dynastic Politicians**

*Equal Co-Author With [Rahul Verma](https://cprindia.org/people/rahul-verma/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Explores perceptions of dynasts versus non-dynasts on political metrics using surveys of 1400 party workers and 2000 voters. Finds that voter preference for dynasts is mediated by their own ambition for higher office.
</div>

#### **Ambition Amongst Party Workers in India**

*Equal Co-Author With [Feyaad Allie](https://www.feyaadallie.com/) and [Rahul Verma](https://cprindia.org/people/rahul-verma/)*

<button onclick="let content = this.nextElementSibling; content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';">Abstract</button>
<div style="display:none;">
- Investigates how rank-and-file workers in hierarchical party systems like India balance political ambition and upward mobility. Initial analysis suggests electoral ambition is mediated by mobility within the party's governing body.
