    "text": "Novel Visual Conjoint Experiment\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nIdeological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India\nUnder Review\n- Explores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through the capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patrons trumps party affiliation amongst BJP-voting Bhils.\n- Mixed-Method Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 voters in 10 villages, 20 elites).\n\n\nChanging Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations\nWith Vikramaditya Thakur\nUnder development with Asian Ethnicity for special-issue\n- Explores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misconception that increased education among Bhils leads to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, the paper argues for a revival of Bhil identity among the educated younger generations due to electoral and social policies.\n- Multi-Method Design: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur).\n\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\n\nNon-Partisan Grassroots Organizations as Electoral Actors in India\nWith Feyaad Allie\n- This project combines two papers:\n1. Examines how non-partisan grassroots organizations (GOs) engage voters during elections using shadowing, a vignette experiment with 720 organizational workers, and a conjoint experiment with 2340 voters.\n2. Explores under what conditions GOs and political parties perceive their collaboration as useful, and how they navigate differences during collaboration using shadowing and vignette experiments with 720 GO and 720 party workers.\n- Pre-registration Links:\n- GO-Voter Engagement (OSF)\n- GO-Party Collaboration (OSF)\n\n\nVacant Local Bodies and Democracy in India\nWith Alyssa Heinze\n- Analyzes the impact of bureaucratic rule on perceptions of service delivery and democracy amid delays in local body elections in Maharashtra.\n- Includes surveys of 2300 voters and 1400 organizational and party workers across four districts and observational analyses of governance data.\n- Pre-registration: OSF\n\n\nAmbition Amongst Party Workers in India\nWith Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma\n- Investigates how rank-and-file workers in hierarchical party systems like India balance political ambition and upward mobility.\n\n\nWho Favors Dynasts in India?\nWith Rahul Verma\n- Explores perceptions of dynasts versus non-dynasts on political metrics using surveys of 1400 party workers and 2000 voters.\n- Initial findings suggest voter preference for dynasts is mediated by their own ambition for higher office.\n\n\n\n\nPublished Dataset\n\nSubdistricts of India by Scheduled Status: An Original Dataset\nDevelopment Data Lab, 2024 - Subdistrict (tehsil/mandal/block) level spatial dataset with information on Fifth and Sixth Scheduled Areas of India.\n- Includes SHRUG location indicators for ease of merging with other datasets.\n\n\n\n\nPublic Writing\n\n“Ladki, bahin…but ethnic groups, caste too” The Times of India, 2024.\n\n“Democracy’s Slow March” The Times of India, 2024.

    "text": "Mapping the Intersection: Average Wait Time for Housing Vouchers in Relation to Minority Household Percentage\n\n\n(With Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski)\nAs a fellow of CAnD3, I coauthored a data visualization that explores the relationship between average wait times for housing vouchers and the percentage of minority households at the county level across the United States.\nHere we have produced a bivariate map of the United States, illustrating the average wait time for households to receive housing vouchers, overlaid with the percentage of minority households using county-level data.\nYou’ll notice as the percentage of minority households increases, there’s a slight tendency for the wait time to also increase.\nIn our visualization, we deliberately chose not to control for population density to highlight the impact of minority density in urban areas. By doing so, we aim to accurately portray the correlation between minority population and wait times for housing vouchers, without diluting the influence of urban demographics on this relationship.\nAs you can see, there’s a graph to the bottom left which indicates a relationship between the average wait time for housing vouchers and the density of minority households. While this general trend may be weak across the nation, here we have identified the spatial distribution of inequities.\nIt is clear that coastal regions, encompassing both the western and eastern coasts, demonstrate a significant clustering of prolonged average wait times and notable densities of minority households. These regions call for specific focus and increased investment in supplementary housing support measures, namely in the supply of available housing units."

    "text": "Hello/Namaskar!\nI am a student, researcher, and practitioner of political representation and development in rural India. My academic and experiential work grapples with questions of how political representation is realized in unexpected and divergent ways, particularly among the indigenous peoples (Adivasis) and non-state interest groups that work outside the electoral channels.\nI do so while balancing multiple hats, collaborating with academics and grassroots organizations (jan sangathans), to observe and improve gaps in political representation. I have previously worked on a project explaining the electoral and ideological dynamics of rising Hindu nationalism in constituencies reserved for Scheduled Tribes in Maharashtra. My upcoming projects involve academic and practical collaborations with grassroots organizations seeking to improve the electoral agency and participation of ethnic and gender minority voters in Maharashtra.\nI graduated with a MA in Political Science (Development Studies) in May 2024 from McGill University, Canada. I have been a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) in Montreal, as well as a fellow at the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Drive Decision-Making (CAnD3). Prior to my MA, I completed a BA (First Class Honours) in Political Science at McGill University."
