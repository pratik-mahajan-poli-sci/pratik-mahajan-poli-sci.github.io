    "text": "Novel Visual Conjoint Experiment\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nIdeological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India\nUnder Review\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExplores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.\nMixed-Method Research Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 voters in 10 villages, 20 elites).\n\n\n\n\nBringing Forward the Past? Persistence of Bhil Tribal Identity Among Youth Amid Rising Hindu Nationalism in Rural Western India\nUnder Review\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nTraces the generational divide in social expression of indigenous identity amongst Bhils in Western India.\n\n\n\n\nDiscretionary Partisans: How Grassroots Organizations Reconcile Mandate and Electoral Engagement\nEqual Co-Author With Feyaad Allie\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nIntroduces the concept of grassroots organizations as discretionary partisans, initiating partisan collaboration with parties but varying its intensity depending on the candidate’s compatibility with their values. Uses shadowing and a vignette experiment with 730 GO and 736 party workers.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\nChanging Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations\nSecond Author With Vikramaditya Thakur\nUnder development with Asian Ethnicity for special-issue\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExplores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misplaced conception that increased education amongst Bhils would lead to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, this paper argues that Bhil tribal identity is seeing a revival amongst the educated and young Bhils due to electoral and social policy factors.\nMulti-Method Research Design: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\n\nOrganizational Expansiveness and Voter Selectivity: How Voters Respond to Partisan Mobilization by Grassroots Organizations\nEqual Co-Author With Feyaad Allie\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExamines how non-partisan grassroots organizations (GOs) engage voters during elections using shadowing, a vignette experiment with 730 organizational workers, and a conjoint experiment with 2368 voters. Explores whether GOs are selective or expansive in partisan voter outreach, and whether this perceived advantage holds up on the voter side.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\nCan Knowledge Make Voters Demand Accountability for Delayed Local Government Elections?\nEqual Co-Author With Alyssa Heinze\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nAnalyzes awareness and impact of bureaucratic rule on perceptions of service delivery and democracy amid delays in local body elections in Maharashtra. This study uses surveys of 2300 voters and 1400 organizational and party workers across four districts. Finding low voter awareness, it seeks to run a follow-up experiment with 3000 voters providing knowledge of local body elected status, to see whether knowledge counters voter apathy.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\nDivergent Marginalization: How Indigenous and Lower Caste Women Face Divergent Outcomes in Rural Governance\nEqual Co-Author With Alyssa Heinze\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nAnalyzing data on 3600 vacant village council seats in Maharashtra (India), we find seats reserved for indigenous women are overrepresented amongst vacant seats three times their share of the population, while vacant Dalit women seats represent just below their share of the population. Using surveys of village council leaders and 3000 voters in Maharashtra, the study seeks to examine the cause and consequence of this divergence.\n\n\n\n\nDynasts and Aspirational Pragmatism: The Role of Electoral Ambition in Shaping Citizens’ Perceptions of Dynastic Politicians\nEqual Co-Author With Rahul Verma\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExplores perceptions of dynasts versus non-dynasts on political metrics using surveys of 1400 party workers and 2000 voters. Finds that voter preference for dynasts is mediated by their own ambition for higher office.\n\n\n\n\nAmbition Amongst Party Workers in India\nEqual Co-Author With Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nInvestigates how rank-and-file workers in hierarchical party systems like India balance political ambition and upward mobility. Initial analysis suggests electoral ambition is mediated by mobility within the party’s governing body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished Dataset\n\nSubdistricts of India by Scheduled Status: An Original Dataset\nDevelopment Data Lab, 2024\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n5969 Indian subdistrict (tehsil/mandal/block) level spatial dataset with information on Fifth and Sixth Scheduled Areas of India.\nCoded with SHRUG subdistrict spatial indicators for ease of merging with other datasets at the Development Data Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Public Writing\n\n“Review or Retention” The Times of India, 2024.\n“Ladki, bahin…but ethnic groups, caste too” The Times of India, 2024.\n“Democracy’s Slow March” The Times of India, 2024.

    "text": "Mapping the Intersection: Average Wait Time for Housing Vouchers in Relation to Minority Household Percentage\n\n\n(With Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski)\nAs a fellow of CAnD3, I coauthored a data visualization that explores the relationship between average wait times for housing vouchers and the percentage of minority households at the county level across the United States.\nHere we have produced a bivariate map of the United States, illustrating the average wait time for households to receive housing vouchers, overlaid with the percentage of minority households using county-level data.\nYou’ll notice as the percentage of minority households increases, there’s a slight tendency for the wait time to also increase.\nIn our visualization, we deliberately chose not to control for population density to highlight the impact of minority density in urban areas. By doing so, we aim to accurately portray the correlation between minority population and wait times for housing vouchers, without diluting the influence of urban demographics on this relationship.\nAs you can see, there’s a graph to the bottom left which indicates a relationship between the average wait time for housing vouchers and the density of minority households. While this general trend may be weak across the nation, here we have identified the spatial distribution of inequities.\nIt is clear that coastal regions, encompassing both the western and eastern coasts, demonstrate a significant clustering of prolonged average wait times and notable densities of minority households. These regions call for specific focus and increased investment in supplementary housing support measures, namely in the supply of available housing units."

    "text": "Hello/Namaskar!\nI am a student, researcher, and practitioner of political representation and development in rural India. My academic and experiential work grapples with questions of how political representation is realized in unexpected and divergent ways, particularly among the indigenous peoples (Adivasis) and non-state interest groups that work outside the electoral channels.\nI do so while balancing multiple hats, collaborating with academics and grassroots organizations (jan sangathans), to observe and improve gaps in political representation. I have previously worked on a project explaining the electoral and ideological dynamics of rising Hindu nationalism in constituencies reserved for Scheduled Tribes in Maharashtra. My upcoming projects involve academic and practical collaborations with grassroots organizations seeking to improve the electoral agency and participation of ethnic and gender minority voters in Maharashtra.\nI graduated with a MA in Political Science (Development Studies) in May 2024 from McGill University, Canada. I have been a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) in Montreal, as well as a fellow at the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Drive Decision-Making (CAnD3). Prior to my MA, I completed a BA (First Class Honours) in Political Science at McGill University."
