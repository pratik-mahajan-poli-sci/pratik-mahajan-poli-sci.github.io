    "text": "Novel Visual Conjoint Experiment\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nIdeological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India\nUnder Review\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExplores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.\nMixed-Method Research Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 voters in 10 villages, 20 elites).\n\n\n\n\nBringing Forward the Past? Persistence of Bhil Tribal Identity Among Youth Amid Rising Hindu Nationalism in Rural Western India\nUnder Review\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nTraces the generational divide in social expression of indigenous identity amongst Bhils in Western India.\n\n\n\n\nDiscretionary Partisans: How Grassroots Organizations Reconcile Mandate and Electoral Engagement\nCo-Author With Feyaad Allie\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nIntroduces the concept of grassroots organizations as discretionary partisans, initiating partisan collaboration with parties but varying its intensity depending on the candidate’s compatibility with their values. Uses shadowing and a vignette experiment with 730 GO and 736 party workers.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\n\nOrganizational Expansiveness and Voter Selectivity: How Voters Respond to Partisan Mobilization by Grassroots Organizations\nCo-Author With Feyaad Allie\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExamines how non-partisan grassroots organizations (GOs) engage voters during elections using shadowing, a vignette experiment with 730 organizational workers, and a conjoint experiment with 2368 voters. Explores whether GOs are selective or expansive in partisan voter outreach, and whether this perceived advantage holds up on the voter side.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\nCan Knowledge Make Voters Demand Accountability for Delayed Local Government Elections?\nCo-Author With Alyssa Heinze\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nAnalyzes awareness and impact of bureaucratic rule on perceptions of service delivery and democracy amid delays in local body elections in Maharashtra. This study uses surveys of 2300 voters and 1400 organizational and party workers across four districts. Finding low voter awareness, it seeks to run a follow-up experiment with 3000 voters providing knowledge of local body elected status, to see whether knowledge counters voter apathy.\nPre-registration: OSF.\n\n\n\n\nDisproportionate Vacancy: Why Indigenous Reserved Seats Remain Vacant in India’s Village Councils\nCo-Author With Alyssa Heinze\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nAnalyzing data on 3600 vacant village council seats in Maharashtra (India), we find seats reserved for indigenous people, and specifically indigenous women are overrepresented amongst vacant seats three times their share of the population. Using surveys of village council leaders and 3000 voters in Maharashtra, the study seeks to examine the cause and consequence of this disproportion vacancy rates.\n\n\n\n\nDynasts and Aspirational Pragmatism: The Role of Electoral Ambition in Shaping Citizens’ Perceptions of Dynastic Politicians\nCo-Author With Rahul Verma\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nExplores perceptions of dynasts versus non-dynasts on political metrics using surveys of 1400 party workers and 2000 voters. Finds that voter preference for dynasts is mediated by their own ambition for higher office.\n\n\n\n\nAmbition Amongst Party Workers in India\nCo-Author With Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nInvestigates how rank-and-file workers in hierarchical party systems like India balance political ambition and upward mobility. Initial analysis suggests electoral ambition is mediated by mobility within the party’s governing body."

    "text": "Hello/Namaskar!\nI am a student and researcher of political representation and development in rural India. My academic and experiential work grapples with questions of how political representation and development is realized in unexpected and divergent ways, particularly among rural tribal communities in India. In Fall 2025, I will begin as a PhD student in Political Science at Yale University.\nCurrently my research pursues four different lines of inquiry. First, my prospective dissertation focuses on how the extension of political self-governance and forest management rights to tribal communities in rural India shape efforts towards community development and climate resilience. Second, in collaboration with Alyssa Heinze, I explain why election delays and vacancies in local governance bodies in India fail to generate political counter-mobilization. Third, with Feyaad Allie, I explain how non-partisan grassroots organizations balance electoral engagement in support of parties while retaining their autonomy. Fourth, in separate projects with Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma, I explain how nascent ambition to run for elected office shapes attitudes of citizens and party workers towards hierarchical party systems and dynastic politics.\nI graduated with a MA in Political Science (Development Studies) in May 2024 from McGill University, Canada. I have been a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) in Montreal, as well as a fellow at the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Drive Decision-Making (CAnD3). Prior to my MA, I completed a BA (First Class Honours) in Political Science at McGill University."

Discrepancies are summarized in documentation."
