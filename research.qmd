### Working Papers

**Ideological Transformation After Patron Co-optation? The Resilience of Ethno-Clientelism Amid Hindu Nationalism in a Scheduled Tribe Constituency in India** *Under Review*

-   Explores the electoral shift of Bhil Scheduled Tribes (ST) in western India towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through capture of local Bhil patrons. Argues that ethnic and material interests remain salient despite increasing Hindu nationalist mobilization, and loyalty to local patron trumps party affiliation amongst BJP voting Bhils.
-   Mixed-Method Research Design: Visual Conjoint Survey (n=678 in 40 villages) and Interviews (n=80 in 10 villages)

**Triangulating Conjoint Findings Amongst Low Literacy and Remote Populations: A Visual and Interview Approach** *Under development as a research note*

-   Critical discussion of the interpretive power of using designed graphics to conduct conjoint analyses, and incorporating subsequent interviews as a robustness check of findings while administering conjoint surveys in contexts where literacy and digital infrastructure are low and outsider skepticism is high.

**Turning Right After Protesting? Measuring the Impact of the Save Narmada Movement on Scheduled Tribes Voting for the Bharatiya Janata Party** *Preliminary Analysis*

-   Utilizing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, the study explores whether dissatisfaction with the failure of the Save Narmada Movement, particularly after the Supreme Court's ruling in favour of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, led to a populist backlash resulting in increased support for the BJP among the Bhil tribes in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.
-   Comparison of BJP vote share in Bhil-dominated assembly constituencies inside and outside the Narmada Basin before and after the Supreme Court's decision, to determine if the movement's failure influenced the electoral rise of the BJP in the Bhil tribal belt. Preliminary analysis points to a null result.

### Ongoing Projects

**Non-Partisan Grassroots Organizations as Electoral Actors: Evidence from Inside an Organizational Campaign in India** (With Feyaad Allie)

-   Ongoing research on the dynamics of Bharat Jodo Abhiyan in Maharashtra, a front of grassroots organizations participating in electoral mobilization.
-   We seek to develop a theory and provide evidence for why grassroots organizations enter electoral politics, and what they perceive their comparative advantage to be vis-a-vis political parties.

**Ambition and Ability amongst Party Workers in India** (With Feyaad Allie and Rahul Verma)

-   Project in its nascent stage.
-   We seek to theorize how rank-and-file party workers in hierarchical party systems such as India balance ambition for political power and upward mobility and the ability to realize that ambition.

**Subdistricts of India by Scheduled Status: An Original Dataset**

-   Subdistrict (tehsil/mandal/block) level spatial dataset with information on Fifth and Sixth Scheduled Areas of India.
-   Coded with SHRUG location indicators for ease of merging with other datasets.

**Mapping the Intersection: Average Wait Time for Housing Vouchers in Relation to Minority Household Percentage** (With Bertram Melix and Megan Skowronski) *Under Development as Spatial Data Visualization*

**Changing Emic Idea of Group Identity Amongst the Bhils and Its Politics Across Generations** (With Vikramaditya Thakur) *Under development with Asian Ethnicity for special-issue*

-   Explores the post-colonial and contemporary evolution of Bhil tribal identity. Against the misplaced conception that increased education amongst Bhils would lead to absorption into mainstream Hindu identity, this paper argues that Bhil tribal identity is seeing a revival amongst the educated and young Bhils due to electoral and social policy factors.
-   Multi-Method Research Design: Elite Interviews and Survey Data Analysis (by Mahajan) and Ethnography and Historiography (by Thakur)
